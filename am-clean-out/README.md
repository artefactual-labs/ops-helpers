# am-clean-out

The `am-clean-out.sh` script cleans pipeline and SS data. It works on AM standalone servers.

Just download the script in the AM server and run as root user:

```
cd /tmp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artefactual-labs/ops-helpers/master/am-clean-out/am-clean-out.sh
chmod +x am-clean-out.sh
./am-clean-out.sh
```
